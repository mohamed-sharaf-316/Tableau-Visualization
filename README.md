# Tableau-Visualization
This project is a data visualization using Tableau for a flight system dataset, the dataset includes data about the flights, airlines, and airports.
I used my visualization skills to communicate findings about the data to discover insights that could enhance future decision making.
The PDf file contains a link for the project on tableau, and some insights about the data and choice of visualization and colors
